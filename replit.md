# Learning Styles Assessment Application

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application designed to help students discover their learning styles through interactive assessments and memory games. The application supports Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic learning styles and provides personalized recommendations. It includes teacher functionality for tracking student progress and managing classroom assessments.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configurable via environment variables)
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration with OAuth2 flow
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions with permanent session configuration
- **User Management**: Flask-Login for user session handling

### Frontend Architecture

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Bootstrap grid system

### Application Structure
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for routes, models, authentication, and app configuration
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation between data models, view templates, and controller logic
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced features with JS

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Replit OAuth Integration**: Custom OAuth consumer blueprint for Replit authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Teacher and student roles with different permissions
- **Session Storage**: Custom UserSessionStorage for OAuth token management
- **Access Control**: Login requirements and permission decorators

### Database Models
- **User Model**: Core user information with teacher/student distinction
- **OAuth Model**: Token storage for authentication sessions
- **Student Model**: Student registration and teacher associations
- **Assessment Models**: QuizResult and MemoryScore for tracking progress

### Learning Assessment System
- **Quiz Engine**: 10-question assessment categorizing learning styles
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Point-based system for Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic preferences
- **Result Processing**: Automatic dominant style calculation and storage
- **Progress Tracking**: Historical results for registered students

### Memory Game Suite
- **Basic Memory Game**: Traditional card-matching with emoji symbols
- **Visual Memory Game**: Shape and color pattern matching with difficulty levels
- **Audio Memory Game**: Sound-based matching using Tone.js for audio generation
- **Kinesthetic Game**: Movement-based games with pattern sequences, gesture matching, and reaction challenges
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Configurable complexity based on user preferences

### Smart Learning Features

- **Style Challenge Game**: Timed quiz testing knowledge of different learning styles with scenarios
- **Progress Tracking**: Streaks, achievements, and performance analytics across all features

### Teacher Dashboard
- **Student Management**: Registration and progress tracking
- **Analytics**: Quiz results and memory game performance metrics
- **Class Organization**: Teacher codes for student registration
- **Data Export**: Student progress summaries and learning style distributions

## Data Flow

### Student Assessment Flow
1. Student takes learning style quiz (anonymous or registered)
2. Responses processed and scored by learning style category
3. Results calculated and stored (if registered)
4. Personalized recommendations and tips provided
5. Memory games suggested based on learning style

### Teacher Management Flow
1. Teacher authenticates via Replit OAuth
2. Unique teacher code generated for class management
3. Students register using teacher code
4. Student progress automatically tracked and aggregated
5. Dashboard provides real-time analytics and insights

### Game Progress Tracking
1. Memory game results captured during gameplay
2. Performance metrics calculated (time, moves, accuracy)
3. Scores stored with student association (if registered)
4. Historical progress available in teacher dashboard

## External Dependencies
